# Python Frameworks

'''
Python offers a diverse range of frameworks tailored to different domains, including web development, machine learning, data science, and graphical user interfaces (GUI). The most popular Python web frameworks are Django, FastAPI, and Flask. 
Popular Python Frameworks
Django: A high-level, "batteries-included" full-stack web framework that encourages rapid development and pragmatic design. It provides built-in tools for an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), authentication, URL routing, and an admin interface, making it ideal for large-scale, complex applications. Instagram and Pinterest are among the notable users of Django. More information is available on the official Django website.
FastAPI: A modern, high-performance web framework designed for building APIs with Python 3.8+ type hints. It is known for its exceptional speed (performance similar to Node.js and Go), automatic interactive API documentation (Swagger UI), and native support for asynchronous programming. It is particularly popular for deploying machine learning models and building microservices. Find documentation on the FastAPI website.
Flask: A lightweight and flexible micro-framework that provides only the essentials for web development. It gives developers full control over application architecture and relies on extensions for additional functionality like database integration or authentication. Its simplicity makes it beginner-friendly and ideal for small projects, prototyping, and data science dashboards. Learn more on the Flask website.

# Python Versions

'''
Python has two major version series, Python 2 (now end-of-life) and Python 3, which is the current and actively developed version. As of December 2025, the latest stable release is Python 3.14.2. 
Key Version Information
Python 2 vs. Python 3: Python 3.0 was a major, backward-incompatible revision released in 2008 to fix fundamental design flaws in Python 2.x. Python 2.7 was the final release of the Python 2 series and reached its official end-of-life on January 1, 2020, meaning it no longer receives security updates. All new development should use Python 3.
Current Supported Versions: The Python Software Foundation (PSF) actively supports several Python 3 versions. As of December 2025, the officially supported stable versions that receive security fixes are:
Python 3.14 (latest stable release)
Python 3.13
Python 3.12
Python 3.11
Python 3.10 (only receiving security updates until October 2026)
Release Cycle: Since version 3.9, a new feature release of Python is made approximately every 12 months, followed by two years of full support and three years of security support.
Performance Improvements: Recent versions of Python 3 have seen significant performance enhancements. Python 3.11 was notably faster than previous versions, and Python 3.12 and 3.13 have continued this trend, with an experimental Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler introduced in 3.13. 
Key Features Introduced in Major 3.x Versions
Each major version adds new features and optimizations: 
Python 3.5: Introduced the async and await keywords for asynchronous programming.
Python 3.6: Added "f-strings" (formatted string literals) for easier string formatting.
Python 3.8: Introduced the "walrus operator" (:=) which allows assignment expressions within a larger expression.
Python 3.10: Added structural pattern matching using match and case statements and improved error messages.
Python 3.13: Introduced an experimental JIT compiler and an experimental free-threaded build mode which can disable the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).
