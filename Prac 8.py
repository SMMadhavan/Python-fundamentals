# History of Python

'''
Python was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and first released in 1991, as a successor to the ABC programming language. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability and simplicity, using significant indentation to define code blocks. 
Origins and Naming
Guido van Rossum began working on Python as a hobby project during the Christmas holidays of 1989 while at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. 
The name "Python" was inspired by the British comedy television series Monty Python's Flying Circus, of which van Rossum was a big fan, not the snake. The name was chosen to be short, unique, and slightly mysterious, and to evoke a sense of fun and playfulness that reflected the language's philosophy. 
Major Versions and Evolution
Python 0.9.0 (February 1991): The first published version, including core features like classes with inheritance, exception handling, functions, and core data types such as list, dict, and str.
Python 1.0 (January 1994): This release introduced functional programming tools like lambda, map, filter, and reduce, and a module system for better code organization.
Python 2.0 (October 2000): A significant milestone that introduced major new features, including list comprehensions, a cycle-detecting garbage collector, and Unicode support. This release also marked a shift to a more transparent, community-backed development process.
Python 3.0 (December 2008): Also known as "Python 3000" or "Py3K", this was a major, backward-incompatible revision designed to fix fundamental design flaws and remove redundant features that had accumulated over time. Key changes included making print a function, improved integer division, and unified str/unicode types.
End of Python 2 (January 2020): After a long coexistence period to allow for migration, support for the Python 2.x series officially ended, with Python 2.7.18 being the final release. 
Modern Era and Governance
For much of its history, van Rossum acted as the project's "Benevolent Dictator for Life" (BDFL), having the final say on all major language changes. In 2018, he stepped down from this role, and the project's governance transitioned to a five-member Steering Council elected by active core developers. 
Today, Python is maintained by the non-profit Python Software Foundation (PSF) and has become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, particularly popular in data science, artificial intelligence, web development, and automation.
